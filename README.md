This code snippet defines a main() function that represents the main logic of a game.

It initializes a game object of the Board class, sets the current_player to 'X', and sets running to True.
It displays the initial state of the game using the display() method of the game object.
It enters a while loop that continues as long as running is True.
Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter the row and column numbers for their move.
It validates the user input, handling exceptions for invalid field indices, occupied cells, and non-numeric input.
If the input is valid, it calls the make_move() method of the game object to make the move for the current player.
It displays the updated game state using the display() method.
It checks if the current player has won the game using the check_win() method of the game object. If so, it prints a message and sets running to False to end the game.
If the game board is full and no one has won, it prints a message for a draw and sets running to False to end the game.
Finally, it toggles the current_player to 'O' if it was 'X', and vice versa, to alternate turns between players.
Overall, this code represents the main logic of a game where players take turns making moves on a game board until a winner is determined or the board is full.
